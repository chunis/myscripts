Note

These scripts can be used to format kernel/driver C source code files to
make them follow Linux code style.
They can process all files under a single directory, follow below steps:
1. run:
	$ ./change_comments.sh <dirname with C source code>
2. Occasionally, the produed C files include embedded C comments, such as:
	/* printf("AA"); /* def */ */
  which is produced because of lines like these:
	//printf("AA"); /* def */
  So we'll need the second script to find out all occurrences of these
  nasty lines by run:
  	$ ./count.sh <dirname with C source code>
